# Godot Flappy Bird
- Flappy Bird in Godot -
A simple project to re-familiarise myself with godot and game dev as a whole

- Goals for the Project -
- Stage 1: Have a functional and playable base game of Flappy Bird
- Stage 2: Add functionality
	- Menu with (Play, Settings and Quit)
	- Settings with (Volume (Master, Music and SFX) and FPS Cap)
	- Current Score and High Score (Would require save files of some sort)
- Stage 3: Make it Pretty
	- Loading transitions from menus
	- Button animations
	- Proper game art
- Stage 4: Polish and Post
	- Fix any final bugs
	- Polish anything that still feels janky
	- Finally, Post onto ITch.io as a first reference project for my Game Dev Journey

- Progress Log

	- The basic game is up and running
	- Player controller is functional and feels good
	- pipe spawning works well but is at a constant rate for now
	- the collision death function and animation works as intended
	- i did have a restart button working but have somehow borked it trying to add a game intro

	- Next session - repair restart button and add SFX
